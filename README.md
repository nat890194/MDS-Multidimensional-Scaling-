# MDS-Multidimensional-Scaling

- The multidimensional scaling approach minimizes the square difference of the pairwise distances between all the training data between the projected, lower dimensional, and original feature higher space.
- Metric Multidimensional Scaling : A generalization of classical multidimensional scaling with a variety of metrics and a loss function optimization. formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the squate difference between the original and projected pairwise distances
